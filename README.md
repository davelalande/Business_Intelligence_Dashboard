BI Dashboard using Google Sheet as data source

This code is a basic business intelligence system for 16 metrics that uses a Google spreadsheet for its data source and Google Visualization.  I developed this for a healthcare company as a proof of concept.

The data is Center for Medicare data that all hospital's publish and is data that is freely available and open to the public about the hospital's performance.  The data is fictitious.

This system could be used by any company using any metrics that you track and want to publish for organization / department use.  The concept is for the data to be kept up-to-date by department Directors.  Included along with the underlying pages is “How can I positively impact this metric?”.  Using the Google lock sheet function, the Directors are giving access to manage the metrics and the “How can I positively impact this metric?” labels.

The spreadsheet that drives the gauges and underlying metric detail pages can be found here.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhCv9Xu_eRnSdHBrU3h2cFJ0Q1lNTWc5LUxVREEzQ0E&usp=sharing

Make a copy of the spreadsheet, lock / protect the individual sheets you don’t want your team to modify and change the labels.

Please feel free to better the code and suggest changes.  I am working on a responsive version of the system and need help.
